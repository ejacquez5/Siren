# Siren
Siren is a home security system that serves a door assistant with regards to visitor at your door, 
whether welcomed or unwelcomed. Using the cameras available on any android phone device, Siren is 
able to sense if motion at a targeted location has been detected and subsequently record a video 
for 10 seconds until motion is not detected. Once a video has been recorded, the video path is added
to the database in order to be retrieved by our in app video list. Users are allowed to set up a personal
profile which includes their name, whether or not they want to receive notification from the app, a
pin number, and a phone number. Once a user adds this information to their settings, the data is 
saved to the database. Users are allowed to view and delete previously recorded videos
through our in app video list that is generated using a listview. 
Out of nine home security systems the average cost was $685 for hardware alone (Figure 1). 
With the current Siren implementation, the cost is reduced to just under $30 dollars with the 
use of the Alcaltel Raven that retails at $29.88in Walmart or Walgreens. We are not saying that
Siren at its current state can perform the samefunctions as the most expensive systems, but through
development and testing, we can help reducethe cost of the secure home and make it more accessible 
to millions of individuals looking for an alternative to the current expensive secure home systems of today.
